## 📘 Project Overview

The notebook `Diabetes Prediction.ipynb` covers the complete ML pipeline:

- 📥 Importing and exploring the dataset
- 🧹 Data preprocessing and cleaning
- 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- 🧠 Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.)
- ✅ Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix
- 📈 Visualization of results and model performance

This project is intended to provide a simple yet effective medical diagnostic tool using machine learning.
